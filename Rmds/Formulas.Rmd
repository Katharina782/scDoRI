$G_{ki} = \frac{e^{\tilde{R}_{ki}}-1}{\sum_k{e^{\tilde{R}_{ki}}-1}}$

$\tilde{A_{ji}} = \frac{A_{ij}}{\sum_{j}{A}_{ij}}$


$\tilde{R_{ki}} = \frac{R_{ki}}{\sum_{k}{R}_{ki}}$


$\frac{U_{kj}}{\sum_{j}{U_{kj}}}$


$e^{-(abs(d/5000))}$ with $d$ being the distance of a tile from the TSS.

$T \in \mathbb{R}^{MxI}$ with $T_{mi}$ corresponding to the number of insertions
mapping to tile $m$ in cell $i$ with values between 1 and 4. 

$D \in \mathbb{R}^{GxM}$ with $D_[gm]$ corresponding to the distance weight for 
tile $m$ in gene window $g$ which has size 200kb (+/- 100kb from TSS).

Gene activity scores are computed as:

$D*T = S$ with $S \in \mathbb{R}^{GxI}$ and $S_{gi}$ corresponding to the gene activity
score for gene $g$ in cell $i$
